This project includes WINBUGS codes (for NMA model) and R code (for arranging data to feed NMA model) for the VenUS 6 NMA model.
Files include:
1. WINBUGS_basecase: the NMA model written for WinBUGS
2. V6_AD_network2: data table for studies with aggregrated data
3. VenUS6_basecase: R codes to arranging data to feed NMA model and run model y R2WiBUGS package
Note that due to data sharing agreement, IPD for VenUS I and VenUS 6 are not provided.

This project also includes R codes and data for VenUS 6 economic model.
File includes:
1. V6_basecase Jan25: decision model
2. Recur_lognormal: parameters for recurrence (Log_normal)
3. Chol_matrix: Variance-covariance matrix for recurrence
4. V6 mortality: lifetable
5. coda1: the NMA output for relative treatment effectiveness (hazard ratio)
6. Resource_use: data tables for resource use
